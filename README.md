# My settings for PrusaSlicer (Alfawise U30)

Here are settings I'm using successfully with my 3D printer "Alfawise U30" for months (years?). This is for the great and easy to use Slicer software [PrusaSlicer](https://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer) I prefer to the other ones (including the most known Cura which is a nightmare on old computers...), it's powerful and light, with a clean UI.
